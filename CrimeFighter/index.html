                        People can report an item missing and those in close vicinity to the crime will be alerted with a description of the object or thief. If they have seen the item or the thief, they can Witness it.

                    <p>
                        Witness allows users who have seen a thief or object after the crime to update the object’s location and provide additional details about the perpetrator.

                        CrimeFighter is designed for closed environments: colleges and schools. A laptop or backpack stolen inside a college or school is likely to remain inside the school. Quick, immediate, and rapid alerts increase the likelihood of finding these items. Using the power of your classmates and the cloud, CrimeFighter revolutionizes tracking small theft in real-time.

                        CrimeFighter isn’t just for stopping crime that has happened, it's also for looking out for crime that might happen. If you forget an item, you can place a Watch on it.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Any users who walk by the location of your forgotten item will receive an alert, and can verify to make sure that them item is still there. Or, they can report that it’s gone.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Someone who forgets their laptop at a location in school might not be able to get to it until the next day. Between the time they leave this item and the time they try to pick it up, dozens of people will walk by.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        If the item gets stolen some time in between, having confirmations that an item was still there at 5:00 but gone at 6:00 helps pinpoint the time of the theft.

                        CrimeFighter uses BigParser’s API to read from historical crime data. It can help people see where past crime was committed, and can help them determine how urgently they need to retrieve their item.

                    <p>
                        Through CrimeFighter, users may find that they left their item in a high-crime area, and thus need to retrieve it as soon as possible. If CrimeFighter tells them that the item is in a low-crime area, they might return at a more convenient but later time.
